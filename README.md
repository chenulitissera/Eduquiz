This code is for a simple web-based flashcard quiz app called "Eduquiz." Here’s how it works:

The user can create flashcards by entering a question and answer, then clicking "Add Flashcard." These are saved in the browser’s localStorage.
The "Clear All" button deletes all saved flashcards.
The "Start Quiz" button switches to study mode, where the user can flip through flashcards, view questions/answers, and flip the card to see the answer.
Navigation buttons ("Previous," "Next," "Exit") let the user move between cards or exit back to creation mode.
The number of saved flashcards is displayed.
All data is stored locally, so it persists between sessions.
The UI is styled for a modern, clean look, and there’s a watermark at the bottom.
The JavaScript handles:

Adding, saving, and clearing flashcards.
Switching between creation and study modes.
Rendering and flipping flashcards.
Navigating between cards.
No backend is used; everything runs in the browser.
